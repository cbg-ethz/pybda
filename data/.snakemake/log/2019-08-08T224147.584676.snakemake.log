rule lda:
    input: iris.tsv
    output: results/2019_08_08/lda.tsv, results/2019_08_08/lda-projection.tsv, results/2019_08_08/lda-plot
    jobid: 0

Removing output files of failed job lda since they might be corrupted:
results/2019_08_08/lda.tsv, results/2019_08_08/lda-projection.tsv, results/2019_08_08/lda-plot
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
