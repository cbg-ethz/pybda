Examples
========

PyBDA provides a wide range of ML algorithms which can easily be used. Below we
provide some examples to help getting started.

On models
---------

- Applying :doc:`dimension-reduction <example_dimension_reduction>` on massive data sets.

- Examples for :doc:`clustering and mixture models <example_clustering>`.

- Fitting :doc:`regression models <example_regression>` to data.

- How to :doc:`combine multiple algorithms <example_multiple_combinations>` with each others in one config file.
