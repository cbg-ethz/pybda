A library for analysis of big biological data sets using Snakemake and Apache Spark.

Introduction
------------

Welcome to ``biospark``.

``biospark`` is a Python/Scala library for analysis of big biological data sets.
We use Apache Spark as analytics engine for big data processing and machine learning,
and Snakemake for scheduling.

The library consists of the following steps:

* Preprocessing: dimension reduction and outlier removal
* Clustering
* Visualizations

The library is still under development, so if you'd like to contribute,
`fork us on GitHub <https://github.com/cbg-ethz/biospark>`_.


Installation
------------

Make sure to have ``python3`` installed. ``biospark`` does not support
previous versions. The best way to do that is to download `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ and create a
virtual `environment <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html>`_.

Download the latest `release <https://github.com/cbg-ethz/biospark/releases>`_ first and install it using:

//# TODOD
