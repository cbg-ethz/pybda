Building DAG of jobs...

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 55 of /Users/simondi/PROJECTS/target_infect_x_project/src/tix-analysis/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/kmeans-plot.log
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job clustering_transform since they might be corrupted:
