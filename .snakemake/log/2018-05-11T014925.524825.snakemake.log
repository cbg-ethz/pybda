Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	clustering
	1	dimred
	1	outliers
	4

rule dimred:
    input: README.md
    output: data/dimension-reduction
    jobid: 3

Finished job 3.
1 of 4 steps (25%) done

rule outliers:
    input: data/dimension-reduction
    output: data/outlier-removal
    jobid: 1

Finished job 1.
2 of 4 steps (50%) done

rule clustering:
    input: data/outlier-removal
    output: data/kmeans-2
    jobid: 2

Finished job 2.
3 of 4 steps (75%) done

localrule all:
    input: data/dimension-reduction, data/outlier-removal, data/kmeans-2
    jobid: 0

Finished job 0.
