MissingOutputException in line 25 of /Users/simondi/PROJECTS/target_infect_x_project/src/tix-analysis/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/kmeans-2
data/kmeans-5
data/kmeans-10
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
