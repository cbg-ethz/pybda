Library
  lib/cisd-jhdf5-core.jar: 
    The Java class files of the JHDF5 library. Requires commons-io.jar, commons-lang.jar and  
    cisd-base.jar on the class path. Requires the native libraries to be provided separately (see 
    below at lib/native).

  lib/cisd-jhdf5-tools.jar: 
    The Java class files of the h5ar archiver. It can be used like 'java -jar cisd-jhdf5-tools.jar'. 
    Requires commons-io.jar, commons-lang.jar, cisd-base.jar, cisd-args4j.jar and cisd-jhdf5-core.jar in 
    the class path. Requires the native libraries to be provided separately (see below at lib/native).

  lib/cisd-jhdf5.jar: 
    All Java class files packaged in one jar file. Requires the native libraries to be provided 
    separately. 

  lib/batteries_included:
    Includes all Java class files of the JHDF5 library and the h5ar archiver and all native 
    libraries necessary to use JHDF5.
    No other file is needed when using one of these jar files. 

	  All supported platforms:
	    lib/batteries_included/cisd-jhdf5-batteries_included_lin_win_mac_sol.jar 
	  
	  Linux/MacOS X/Windows, but no Solaris support: 
	    lib/batteries_included/cisd-jhdf5-batteries_included_lin_win_mac.jar
	    
  lib/native:
    The native libraries as files in folders jhdf5 and unix. In order to use them ensure that you 
    point the Java property native.libpath to the root of this hierarchy,
    e.g.: "-Dnative.libpath=/home/joe/lib/native"

  lib/nativejar:
    The jar files in this folder contain the native libraries for each platform, e.g. 
    hdf5-linux-intel.jar has the shared libraries for Linux on Intel/AMD. Note that these jar 
    files do not contain the Java class files. In order to make use of these jar files you need
    to ensure that the file for your platform is in the class path of the jre.
 
Wrapper
  bin/h5ar.sh:
    A script that calls h5ar by invoking the JRE with appropriate parameters. Suitable for being 
    symlinked to e.g. /usr/local/bin
  bin/h5ar.bar:
    Example script on how to most easily invoke h5ar on Windows. Needs to be adapted to have the 
    fully qualified path to the jar file.
